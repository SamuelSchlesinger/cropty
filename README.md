# Cropty

A little library for doing encryption using a combination of RSA and AEP, using the
[cryptonite](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite) library for cryptography.

It is meant for use with very large files. I've tested it on a 6 Gigabyte file and it
works within seconds for all functions.
